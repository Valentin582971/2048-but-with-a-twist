# 2048-but-with-a-twist  
  
2048 is boring, but I add a little spice to have an infinite 2048 !  
I let you play, so have fun !  
  
The 2048 but with a twist.py function perfectly... Except the AI... 
There is a variable called 'use_ai' that you can put to false in order to play mannually.  
So I make (it's in the oven, let me cook !) a CUDA C++ code, just it's not as pretty as a interface...  
Hope this AI will work...  
  
Huge thanks to my old good friend Chat GPT, you can reuse my code but please, credit me. As always, I won't come into your house but I would be happy if you do.  

Have fun !
